I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://github.com/tufts-ml/" target="_blank">Machine Learning Research Group</a> at <a href="https://www.tufts.edu/" target="_blank">Tufts University</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.michaelchughes.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Michael C. Hughes</a>. I do research in machine learning for healthcare, with a focus on probabilistic machine learning and Bayesian deep learning.

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics minor from <a href="https://www.gcc.edu/" target="_blank">Grove City College</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://www.gcc.edu/Home/Academics/Faculty-Directory/Faculty-Detail/jonathan-o-hutchins" target="_blank">Dr. Jonathan O. Hutchins</a> on acoustic gait analysis using unsupervised learning.
