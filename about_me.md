## About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Machine Learning Research Group](https://github.com/tufts-ml/) at [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/), advised by [Dr. Michael C. Hughes](https://www.michaelchughes.com/). I do research in machine learning for healthcare, with a focus on probabilistic machine learning and Bayesian deep learning.

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics minor from [Grove City College](https://www.gcc.edu/), where I worked with [Dr. Jonathan O. Hutchins](https://www.gcc.edu/Home/Academics/Faculty-Directory/Faculty-Detail/jonathan-o-hutchins) on acoustic gait analysis using unsupervised learning.
